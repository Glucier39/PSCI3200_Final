Since 2000, “39 Chinese lenders provided 1,243 loans amounting to $170.08 billion to 49 African governments and seven regional institutions” (Boston University Global Development Policy Center, 2023). To meet China’s growing energy demand, a significant share of this financing has flowed to petrostates - countries whose economies are heavily dependent on the extraction and export of oil and natural gas (Sow, 2018).While there has been debate about the purpose of these loans, analysis have shown that they are critical for reducing trade costs with that country and increasing participation in global value chains (Amendolagine et al., 2024). Well established, is the fact that these loans are targeted towards resource cursed nations.\nAfrica’s resource-rich nations frequently encounter a paradox: despite their natural resource endowments, they fail to achieve sustained economic progress. Known as the resource curse or the “paradox of plenty”, these “countries with large endowments of natural resources, such as oil and gas, often perform worse in terms of economic development and governance than do countries with fewer resources” (Soros, 2007). Fundamentally, scholars note how the economic potential of resource wealth distorts governance incentives, enabling ruling elites to consolidate power, evade public accountability, and suppress institutional checks (National Resource Governance Institute, 2015). When government spending depends more on citizen taxation, those governments are more likely to democratize or circulate democratic values. Conversely, when governments rely heavily on resource rents to fund the national budget, public oversight tends to diminish and allows elites greater freedom to divert funds for personal gain (National Resource Governance Institute, 2015). Consequently, less money is reinvested into infrastructure and the country is forced to take out loans.\nThese loans have taken the “form of “loan-for-oil” agreements in which Chinese state development banks lend billions of dollars to oil-producing countries at below-market interest rates in exchange for the producers’ agreements to sell oil to Chinese oil companies (at future market prices rather than at a fixed price)” (Gholz, 2017). Moreover, while these loans do not always directly fund resource extraction, they are collateralized by future resource revenues (Usman, 2001). This financing model raises important questions about its implications for governance: oil-rich nations not only reflect the structural conditions associated with the resource curse (weak governance, rent seeking), but increasingly depend on opaque, collateralized lending arrangements that lack the transparency and accountability mechanisms commonly required by traditional lenders like the World Bank. Through these large, unconditional financial inflows, already corrupt governments can effectively bypass legislative oversight and public scrutiny.\nFoundational work in resource curse literature, including studies by Ross (2001) and Auty (1993), demonstrates how resource-rich governments bypass the need for taxation and public accountability by leveraging resource revenues to entrench political power. At the local level, Isaksson and Kotsadam (2016) find that Chinese development projects are associated with increased local corruption in African countries. However, despite growing attention to China’s role as a lender, there remains a significant gap in the literature concerning the broader, country-level effects of Chinese loans on executive corruption across resource-rich states. Given the literature linking loans to corruption and the recent increase in Chinese loans to Africa, I wanted to see if there was a relationship between the two. Moreover, I think that understanding these loans reinforce corruption has important implications for development policy and environmental sustainability as a whole. This study aims to measure the impact of the Chinese loans country’s measure of executive corruption.\n\n\nTheory and Hypotheses\n\nHypothesis: In oil-rich African countries, higher inflows of Chinese development loans in a given year cause increases in executive corruption\nThis hypothesis aims to find a causal relationship between the amount of Chinese loans a country receives within a given year and that same country’s executive corruption score (as constructed by the Varieties of Democracy Institute).\nThis hypothesis is grounded in two well-established strands of political economy literature: the resource curse and the governance implications of unconditional foreign lending. As previously stated, resource curse theory posits that resource wealth weakens institutions by allowing elites to rely on rents instead of taxation. Moreover, the need for these loans to repair crumbling infrastructure (because the elites have redirected money to themselves and their party) supports the claim that reliance on rents tends to erode democratic governance and foster corruption. Chinese development loans should hypothetically amplify these dynamics. Unlike traditional lenders such as the IMF or World Bank, Chinese financing is typically opaque, collateralized by future oil revenues, and largely free of governance or transparency conditions. As opposed to taking a traditional lender’s loan, which would require strict oversight and institutional reform, corrupt governments would much rather choose an unconditional loan, even if it favors China in the long term.\nGiven these theoretical mechanisms, it is reasonable to expect that an increase in Chinese development financing in oil-rich African states will correlate with rising levels of executive corruption. These funds not only reinforce the resource curse by freeing elites from domestic accountability, but also enable corruption by operating outside the bounds of public financial management systems. Compared to other types of corruption within the V-Dem index (public sector, legislative corruption, judicial corruption), executive is the most theoretically relevant and empirically appropriate proxy for this study. Chinese development loans are typically negotiated and managed at the highest levels of government, often through executive channels such as ministries of finance, state-owned enterprises, or heads of state themselves. Rather than testing the impact of Chinese loans on judiciary, legislative, or public sector corruption (or the aggregate political corruption index combining all), executive corruption should see the most pronounced impact and relationship.\nStill, it is important to recognize that any observed change in executive corruption linked to Chinese loans is likely to be modest. In resource-rich African countries, corruption and governance outcomes are shaped by a complex constellation of historical, political, and institutional factors - ranging from legacies of colonialism to the structure and ideology of ruling parties. Chinese development finance represents just one piece of a much larger puzzle. As countries deepen their reliance on natural resource revenues, many are already on a trajectory consistent with the resource curse in which corruption tends to rise incrementally over time. Therefore, it would be overly simplistic to frame Chinese loans as the primary driver of corruption. Instead, they should be understood as a contributing factor that may reinforce existing governance vulnerabilities within broader patterns of institutional decline.\nWhile China has distributed development loans across a wide range of African countries, a stronger effect on corruption is expected in petrostates. According to Ross (2001), petroleum wealth is particularly harmful to institutional quality (undermining governance, rule of law, increasing corruption) due to the centralized, high-value, and capital-intensive nature of oil extraction. Unlike minerals such as diamonds or gold, which are often extracted through more decentralized and labor-intensive processes, oil requires massive upfront investments in infrastructure like pipelines, refineries, and export terminals. This makes oil-exporting states more dependent on large-scale financing and more likely to engage in opaque “loan-for-oil” deals with external lenders such as China. Simultaneously, Chinese infrastructure loans serve a much more strategic benefit in petrostates."
