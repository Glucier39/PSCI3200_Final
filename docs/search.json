Since 2000, “39 Chinese lenders provided 1,243 loans amounting to $170.08 billion to 49 African governments and seven regional institutions” (Boston University Global Development Policy Center, 2023). To meet China’s growing energy demand, a significant share of this financing has flowed to petrostates - countries whose economies are heavily dependent on the extraction and export of oil and natural gas (Sow, 2018).While there has been debate about the purpose of these loans, analysis have shown that they are critical for reducing trade costs with that country and increasing participation in global value chains (Amendolagine et al., 2024). Well established, however, is the fact that these loans are targeted towards resource cursed nations.\nAfrica’s resource-rich nations frequently encounter a paradox: despite their abundant natural resource endowments, they often fail to achieve inclusive and sustained economic progress. Known as the resource curse or the “paradox of plenty”, these “countries with large endowments of natural resources, such as oil and gas, often perform worse in terms of economic development and governance than do countries with fewer resources,” despite the “prospects of wealth and opportunity that accompany the discovery and extraction” (Soros, 2007). As a pillar of this research, scholars note how the economic potential of resource wealth distorts governance incentives, enabling ruling elites to consolidate power, evade public accountability, and suppress institutional checks (National Resource Governance Institute, 2015). When government spending is more dependent on citizen taxation, those same governments are more likely to democratize or circulate democratic values. Conversely, when governments rely heavily on resource rents (rather than citizen taxation) to fund the national budget, public oversight tends to diminish and allows elites greater freedom to divert funds for personal gain (National Resource Governance Institute, 2015). Consequently, less money is reinvested into infrastructure and country is forced to take out loans.\nThese loans have taken the “form of “loan-for-oil” agreements in which Chinese state development banks lend billions of dollars to oil-producing countries at below-market interest rates in exchange for the producers’ agreements to sell oil to Chinese oil companies (at future market prices rather than at a fixed price)” (Gholz, 2017). Moreover, while these loans do not always directly fund resource extraction, they are collateralized by future resource revenues; a structure in which the borrowing country commits future earnings from oil or mineral exports to repay Chinese creditors (Usman, 2001). This financing model raises important questions about its implications for governance: oil-rich nations not only reflect the structural conditions associated with the resource curse (weak governance, rent seeking), but increasingly depend on opaque, collateralized lending arrangements that lack the transparency and accountability mechanisms commonly required by traditional lenders. This convergence becomes particulary problematic in contexts where institutions are already fragile. Through these large, unconditional financial inflows, already corrupt governments can effectively bypass legislative oversight and public scrutiny.\nFoundational work in resource curse literature, including studies by Ross (2001) and Auty (1993), demonstrates how resource-rich governments frequently bypass the need for taxation and public accountability by leveraging resource revenues to entrench political power. At the local level, Isaksson and Kotsadam (2016) find that Chinese development projects are associated with increased local corruption in African countries. However, despite growing attention to China’s role as a lender, there remains a significant gap in the literature concerning the broader, country-level effects of Chinese loans on executive corruption across resource-rich states. This study aims to measure the impact of Chinese loans country’s measure of executive corruption using statistical regression techniques."
